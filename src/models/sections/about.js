        body: `I'm a full-stack engineer that specializes in front-end web development. After earning a degree in music composition and working for several years as a professional musician on cruise ships, I realized a musician's lifestyle was not for me, and so decided to reinvent myself by going back to school to study computer science. With my background in both the arts and sciences and a knack for getting things done, I believe I can make a positive contribution to any team.`
