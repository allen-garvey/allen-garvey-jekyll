<h2 class="home-text-title">Hi, I&#8217;m Allen.</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m a software developer, but I&#8217;ve been at times a composer, cruise ship musician and artist. <strong>I love making beautiful things, teaching others and figuring out how things work.</strong> My specialty is web development, both front-end and back-end, but I also have experience with native iOS, Android and Mac development, as well as cross-platform mobile development.</p>
