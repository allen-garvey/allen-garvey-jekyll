<h2>Hi, I'm Allen.</h2>
<p>I'm a software developer, but I've been at times a composer, cruise ship musician and art student. Through my journeys I've earned some lessons such as: appreciation for other cultures, the value of craftsmanship and deep practice, attention to detail, how to design something that doesn't look terrible and how to travel light, all of which I try to always keep with me.</p>
