<h2 class="home-text-title">Hi, I'm Allen.</h2>
<p>I'm a software developer, but I've been at times a composer, cruise ship musician and artist. <strong>I like making beautiful things, sharing what I know and figuring out how things work.</strong> Some of my current interests include: using technology to create and enhance music and art, improving education and using data visualizations to illuminate hidden underlying connections.</p>
