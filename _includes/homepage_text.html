<h2 class="home-text-title">Hi, I&#8217;m Allen.</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m a software developer, but I&#8217;ve been at times a composer, cruise ship musician and artist. <strong>I like making beautiful things, sharing what I know and figuring out how things work.</strong> I consider myself a full-stack developer because I&#8217;m just as comfortable designing and implementing the user interface, managing JavaScript frameworks and consuming APIs as I am planning the database schema and implementing those same back end routes and APIs. Some of my current interests include: using technology to create and enhance music and art, improving education and using data visualizations to illustrate hidden underlying connections.</p>
