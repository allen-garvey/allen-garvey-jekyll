<p>I consider myself a full-stack developer because I&#8217;m just as comfortable designing and implementing the user interface and handling user interaction as I am planning the database schema and implementing back end routes and APIs. My focus has centered around web development because I believe that it&#8217;s the easiest way to reach people, and the future of computer applications. As a result of my diverse education, I have also had experience with native iOS, Android and Mac OSX development and am intimately familiar with Adobe&#8217;s Create Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign) from my studies in graphic design.</p>
