<p>I consider myself a full-stack developer because I&#8217;m just as comfortable designing and implementing the user interface, managing JavaScript frameworks and consuming APIs as I am planning the database schema and implementing those same back end routes and APIs. My recent projects have centered around web development (where I&#8217;ve focused on PHP, Ruby and JavaScript) because I&#8217;ve learned that that&#8217;s the easiest way to reach people. As a result of my diverse education, I have also had experience with native iOS, Android and Mac OSX development and am intimately familiar with Adobe&#8217;s Create Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign) from my studies in graphic design.</p>
