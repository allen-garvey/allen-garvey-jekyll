<p>I believe skill is just a means to an end and I learn best when solving real problems. My recent interests have centered around web development (where I&#8217;ve focused on PHP, Ruby and JavaScript) because I&#8217;ve learned that that&#8217;s the easiest way to reach people. As a result of my diverse education, I have also had experience with native iOS, Android and Mac OSX development and am intimately familiar with Adobe&#8217;s Create Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign) from my studies in graphic design.</p>
