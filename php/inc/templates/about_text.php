<h2 class="home-text-title">Hi, I&#8217;m Allen.</h2>
<p>
	I&#8217;m a full-stack engineer that specializes in front-end web development. After earning a degree in music composition and working for several years as a professional musician on cruise ships, I realized a musician&#8217;s lifestyle was not for me, and so decided to reinvent myself by going back to school to study computer science. With my background in both the arts and sciences and a commitment to getting things done, I believe I can make a valuable contribution to any team.
